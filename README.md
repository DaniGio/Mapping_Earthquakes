# Mapping Earthquakes 
## Project overview

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Resources
Tool: GeoJson, D3, leaflet library and Mapbox API
Source types: .csv files and APIs
Language: JavaScript, html

## Summary
The project is to support Disaster Reporting Network, a nonprofit company that provides data driven storytelling on disasters around the world, to build an insightful data visualization with interactive features on earthquakes around the world. 

Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude has a larger diameter and darker in color (as shown in legend in the bottom right):
 

Also, each earthquake have a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

It is possible to see the map with different layers, as Street view, Satellite view and Light view. It is also possible to see with the technique plaques and/or with each earthquake. 

Below some examples:
